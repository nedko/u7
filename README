u7 is a program for controlling ALSA volume through Linux input
device.

Input device events are read and when KEY_VOLUMEDOWN or KEY_VOLUMEUP
is received, ALSA volume is adjusted.

The program was designed for Asus Xonar U7 USB soundcard, but is
probably also useful with other devices. For Xonar U7, the program is
expected to work without supplying additional command-line
arguments. To see possible command-line arguments, run the program
with --help argument.

The program could possibly be built like this:

cc *.c -o u7

The u7.c file is written by Nedko Arnaudov. The mixer.c, asound.h
and asoundlib.h files are borrowed from tinyalsa project.
